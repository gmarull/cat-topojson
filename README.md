# Utility to generate TopoJSON maps for Catalonia

This repository provides a utility to generate
[TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson) maps for Catalonia using the
source maps provided by [ICGC](//www.icc.cat/vissir3).

You may find this [article](http://teslabs.com/articles/topojson-catalonia)
useful to better understand what this utility does.

**NOTE:** Source maps are produced by ICGC and are subject to [terms of
use](//www.icc.cat/conditions).

## Preliminary requirements

Before you can use this utility, you will need to obtain the source maps. They
are freely available from [ICGC](http://www.icc.cat/vissir3) (registration is
required). The maps of interest are called *Base Municipal* and are offered in
multiple scales (1:50, 1:250 and 1:1000) and formats (DXF, DGN and SHP). This
utility only supports SHP format.

Regarding software, the first requirement is the TopoJSON host tool,
``topojson``, which in turn requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/en/). If you
are on OS X, and assuming you use [brew](http://brew.sh/), you can easily get
both by typing:

    $ brew install node
    $ npm install -g topojson

In case of converting from one coordinate system to another you will also need
[GDAL](//www.gdal.org/). It can also be installed using ``brew``:

    $ brew install gdal

## Getting started

To get started, clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/teslabs/cat-topojson

Then, copy the downloaded source maps file (.zip) to the root of the cloned
repository. Once done, you can generate the maps by simply typing:

    make

The following maps are generated in the `topo/` directory:

* `cat-caps.json`: Location of the capital cities for each municipality
* `cat-municipis.json`: Municipalities polygons
* `cat-comarques.json`: Counties polygons
* `cat-provincies.json`: Provinces polygons
* `cat.json`: Combination of all of the above

Using the default parameters will generate projected maps (see all available
parameters and their defaults below). You can open any of the examples to verify
the generated maps.

## Parameters

### Geographical coordinates

By default projected maps are generated, as ICGC source maps are already
projected. However, you can also generate maps in geographical coordinates by
setting the `GEO` parameter. By default it will generate maps in the WGS-84
coordinate system. You can change this by setting `GEO_COORD` to any of the
supported coordinate systems by ``ogr2ogr``.

### Dimensions

When generating projected maps, three parameters can be used to control the
dimensions of the generated map: `WIDTH` (default to 500 px), `HEIGHT` and
`MARGIN`.

### Simplification and quantization

Simplification can be set using the `SIMPLIFICATION` parameter. It defaults to 2
px<sup>2</sup> for projected maps and to 10<sup>-8</sup> sr for geographic
coordinates.

Quantization can be set using the `QUANTIZATION` parameter. It has no default,
which means that `topojson` default (10<sup>4</sup>) is used.

### Maps version

ICGC maps file names are in the format
`bm[eeee]mv33sh1f{xx}[m]_[aaaammdd]_[c].shp` where:

* `eeee` is the scale (i.e., 50, 250, 1000)
* `m` is the frame coordinate reference (only 1 is available, meaning
  EPSG:25831 - ETRS89 / UTM zone 31N)
* `aaaammdd` is the maps reference date (e.g. 20150501)
* `c` is the distribution revision (e.g. 0)
* `xx` identifies the map (e.g. `mp` is for municipalities polygons)

A couple of parameters can be set to change the maps used: `SCALE` (default to
50) and `DATE` (default to 20150501).

## Examples

You can verify that the maps have been generated properly by opening any of the
examples found in ``examples``. You will first need to link or copy the
generated `topo` folder containing the maps and launch them using an HTTP
server, e.g.

    cd examples/
    ln -s ../topo .
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

`example-proj.html` requires projected maps to work properly. As already
said, projected maps are generated by default. Parameters may be set like this:

    make WIDTH=250 MARGIN=10 SIMPLIFICATION=10

`example-geo.html` requires maps in geographical coordinates to work properly.
The simplest way to generate them using defaults is to just set `GEO`:

    make GEO=1
